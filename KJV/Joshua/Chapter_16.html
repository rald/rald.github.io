This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.<br/><br/>9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.<br/><br/>10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.<br/><br/>
