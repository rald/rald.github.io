This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.<br/><br/>7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.<br/><br/>8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.<br/><br/>9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.<br/><br/>10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:<br/><br/>11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.<br/><br/>12 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.<br/><br/>13 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.<br/><br/>
