He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.<br/><br/>2 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.<br/><br/>3 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.<br/><br/>4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.<br/><br/>5 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?<br/><br/>6 For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.<br/><br/>7 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.<br/><br/>8 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.<br/><br/>9 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.<br/><br/>10 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.<br/><br/>11 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.<br/><br/>12 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.<br/><br/>13 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.<br/><br/>14 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.<br/><br/>
