For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.<br/><br/>9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.<br/><br/>10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.<br/><br/>11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.<br/><br/>12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.<br/><br/>13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<br/><br/>14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.<br/><br/>15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<br/><br/>16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<br/><br/>17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?<br/><br/>18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br/><br/>19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.<br/><br/>20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.<br/><br/>21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.<br/><br/>22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.<br/><br/>23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.<br/><br/>24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.<br/><br/>
