And he said, Of a child.<br/><br/>22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.<br/><br/>23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.<br/><br/>24 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.<br/><br/>25 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.<br/><br/>26 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.<br/><br/>27 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.<br/><br/>28 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?<br/><br/>29 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.<br/><br/>30 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.<br/><br/>31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.<br/><br/>32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.<br/><br/>33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?<br/><br/>34 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.<br/><br/>35 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.<br/><br/>36 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,<br/><br/>37 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.<br/><br/>38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.<br/><br/>39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.<br/><br/>40 For he that is not against us is on our part.<br/><br/>41 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.<br/><br/>42 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.<br/><br/>43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:<br/><br/>44 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.<br/><br/>45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:<br/><br/>46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.<br/><br/>47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:<br/><br/>48 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.<br/><br/>49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.<br/><br/>50 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.<br/><br/>
