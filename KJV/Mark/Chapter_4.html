And there were also with him other little ships.<br/><br/>37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.<br/><br/>38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?<br/><br/>39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.<br/><br/>40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?<br/><br/>41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?<br/><br/>
