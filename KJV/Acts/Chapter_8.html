And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.<br/><br/>2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.<br/><br/>3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.<br/><br/>4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.<br/><br/>5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.<br/><br/>6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.<br/><br/>7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.<br/><br/>8 And there was great joy in that city.<br/><br/>9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:<br/><br/>10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.<br/><br/>11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.<br/><br/>12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.<br/><br/>13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.<br/><br/>14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:<br/><br/>15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:<br/><br/>16 For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)<br/><br/>17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.<br/><br/>18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,<br/><br/>19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.<br/><br/>20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.<br/><br/>21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.<br/><br/>22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<br/><br/>23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.<br/><br/>24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.<br/><br/>25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.<br/><br/>26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.<br/><br/>27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,<br/><br/>28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.<br/><br/>29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.<br/><br/>30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?<br/><br/>31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.<br/><br/>32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:<br/><br/>33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.<br/><br/>34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?<br/><br/>35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.<br/><br/>36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?<br/><br/>37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.<br/><br/>38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.<br/><br/>39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.<br/><br/>40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.<br/><br/>
