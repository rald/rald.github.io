Fare ye well.<br/><br/>30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:<br/><br/>31 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.<br/><br/>32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.<br/><br/>33 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.<br/><br/>34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.<br/><br/>35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.<br/><br/>36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.<br/><br/>37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.<br/><br/>38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.<br/><br/>39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;<br/><br/>40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.<br/><br/>41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.<br/><br/>
