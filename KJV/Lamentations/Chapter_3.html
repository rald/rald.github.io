he turneth his hand against me all the day.<br/><br/>4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.<br/><br/>5 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.<br/><br/>6 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.<br/><br/>7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.<br/><br/>8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.<br/><br/>9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.<br/><br/>10 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.<br/><br/>11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.<br/><br/>12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.<br/><br/>13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.<br/><br/>14 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.<br/><br/>15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.<br/><br/>16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.<br/><br/>17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.<br/><br/>18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:<br/><br/>19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.<br/><br/>20 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.<br/><br/>21 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.<br/><br/>22 It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.<br/><br/>23 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.<br/><br/>24 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.<br/><br/>25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.<br/><br/>26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.<br/><br/>27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.<br/><br/>28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.<br/><br/>29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.<br/><br/>30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.<br/><br/>31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever:<br/><br/>32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.<br/><br/>33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.<br/><br/>34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,<br/><br/>35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,<br/><br/>36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.<br/><br/>37 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?<br/><br/>38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?<br/><br/>39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?<br/><br/>40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.<br/><br/>41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.<br/><br/>42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.<br/><br/>43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.<br/><br/>44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.<br/><br/>45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.<br/><br/>46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.<br/><br/>47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.<br/><br/>48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br/><br/>49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,<br/><br/>50 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.<br/><br/>51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.<br/><br/>52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.<br/><br/>53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.<br/><br/>54 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.<br/><br/>55 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.<br/><br/>56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.<br/><br/>57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.<br/><br/>58 O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.<br/><br/>59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.<br/><br/>60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.<br/><br/>61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;<br/><br/>62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.<br/><br/>63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.<br/><br/>64 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.<br/><br/>65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.<br/><br/>66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.<br/><br/>
