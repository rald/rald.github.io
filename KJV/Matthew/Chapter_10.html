If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?<br/><br/>26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.<br/><br/>27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.<br/><br/>28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.<br/><br/>29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.<br/><br/>30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<br/><br/>31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.<br/><br/>32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.<br/><br/>33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.<br/><br/>34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.<br/><br/>35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.<br/><br/>36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.<br/><br/>37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.<br/><br/>38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.<br/><br/>39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.<br/><br/>40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.<br/><br/>41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.<br/><br/>42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.<br/><br/>
