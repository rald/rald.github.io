Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.<br/><br/>7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,<br/><br/>8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.<br/><br/>9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<br/><br/>10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:<br/><br/>11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.<br/><br/>12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?<br/><br/>13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.<br/><br/>14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.<br/><br/>15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.<br/><br/>16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?<br/><br/>17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?<br/><br/>18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.<br/><br/>19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:<br/><br/>20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.<br/><br/>21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.<br/><br/>22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.<br/><br/>23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.<br/><br/>24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br/><br/>25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.<br/><br/>26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.<br/><br/>27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.<br/><br/>28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.<br/><br/>29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.<br/><br/>30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:<br/><br/>31 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.<br/><br/>32 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.<br/><br/>33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?<br/><br/>34 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.<br/><br/>35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.<br/><br/>36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.<br/><br/>37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.<br/><br/>38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.<br/><br/>39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.<br/><br/>
