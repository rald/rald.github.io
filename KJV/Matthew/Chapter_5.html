A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.<br/><br/>15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<br/><br/>16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<br/><br/>17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br/><br/>18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br/><br/>19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br/><br/>20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br/><br/>21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:<br/><br/>22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.<br/><br/>23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;<br/><br/>24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<br/><br/>25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.<br/><br/>26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.<br/><br/>27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:<br/><br/>28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.<br/><br/>29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<br/><br/>30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<br/><br/>31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:<br/><br/>32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.<br/><br/>33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:<br/><br/>34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:<br/><br/>35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.<br/><br/>36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.<br/><br/>37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.<br/><br/>38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:<br/><br/>39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.<br/><br/>40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.<br/><br/>41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.<br/><br/>42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.<br/><br/>43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<br/><br/>44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br/><br/>45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.<br/><br/>46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?<br/><br/>47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?<br/><br/>48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.<br/><br/>
