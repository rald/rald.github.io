And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.<br/><br/>30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.<br/><br/>31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?<br/><br/>32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.<br/><br/>33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.<br/><br/>34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.<br/><br/>35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;<br/><br/>36 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.<br/><br/>
