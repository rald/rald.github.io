Then he suffered him.<br/><br/>16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:<br/><br/>17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br/><br/>
