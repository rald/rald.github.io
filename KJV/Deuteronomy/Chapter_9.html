But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.<br/><br/>20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.<br/><br/>21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.<br/><br/>22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.<br/><br/>23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.<br/><br/>24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.<br/><br/>25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.<br/><br/>26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.<br/><br/>27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:<br/><br/>28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.<br/><br/>29 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.<br/><br/>
