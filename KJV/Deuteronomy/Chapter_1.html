our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.<br/><br/>29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.<br/><br/>30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;<br/><br/>31 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.<br/><br/>32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,<br/><br/>33 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.<br/><br/>34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,<br/><br/>35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,<br/><br/>36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.<br/><br/>37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.<br/><br/>38 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.<br/><br/>39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.<br/><br/>40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.<br/><br/>41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.<br/><br/>42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.<br/><br/>43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.<br/><br/>44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.<br/><br/>45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.<br/><br/>46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.<br/><br/>
