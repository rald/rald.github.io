And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.<br/><br/>16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.<br/><br/>17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.<br/><br/>18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.<br/><br/>19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.<br/><br/>20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.<br/><br/>21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.<br/><br/>22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.<br/><br/>23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.<br/><br/>24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.<br/><br/>25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.<br/><br/>26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.<br/><br/>27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.<br/><br/>28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?<br/><br/>29 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.<br/><br/>30 So the people rested on the seventh day.<br/><br/>31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.<br/><br/>32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.<br/><br/>34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.<br/><br/>35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.<br/><br/>36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.<br/><br/>
