And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.<br/><br/>12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.<br/><br/>13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:<br/><br/>14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.<br/><br/>15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:<br/><br/>16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.<br/><br/>17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.<br/><br/>18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?<br/><br/>19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.<br/><br/>20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.<br/><br/>21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.<br/><br/>22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.<br/><br/>
