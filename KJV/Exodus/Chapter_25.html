gold, and silver, and brass,<br/><br/>4 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,<br/><br/>5 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,<br/><br/>6 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,<br/><br/>7 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.<br/><br/>8 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.<br/><br/>9 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.<br/><br/>10 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.<br/><br/>11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.<br/><br/>12 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.<br/><br/>13 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.<br/><br/>14 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.<br/><br/>15 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.<br/><br/>16 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.<br/><br/>17 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.<br/><br/>18 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.<br/><br/>19 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.<br/><br/>20 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.<br/><br/>21 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.<br/><br/>22 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.<br/><br/>23 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.<br/><br/>24 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.<br/><br/>25 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.<br/><br/>26 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.<br/><br/>27 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.<br/><br/>28 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.<br/><br/>29 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them.<br/><br/>30 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.<br/><br/>31 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.<br/><br/>32 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:<br/><br/>33 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.<br/><br/>34 And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.<br/><br/>35 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.<br/><br/>36 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.<br/><br/>37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.<br/><br/>38 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.<br/><br/>39 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.<br/><br/>40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.<br/><br/>
