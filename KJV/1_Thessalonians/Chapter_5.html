And be at peace among yourselves.<br/><br/>14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.<br/><br/>15 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.<br/><br/>16 Rejoice evermore.<br/><br/>17 Pray without ceasing.<br/><br/>18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.<br/><br/>19 Quench not the Spirit.<br/><br/>20 Despise not prophesyings.<br/><br/>21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.<br/><br/>22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.<br/><br/>23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>24 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.<br/><br/>25 Brethren, pray for us.<br/><br/>26 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.<br/><br/>27 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.<br/><br/>28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. <br/><br/>
