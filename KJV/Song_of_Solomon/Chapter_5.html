I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?<br/><br/>4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.<br/><br/>5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.<br/><br/>6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.<br/><br/>7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.<br/><br/>8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.<br/><br/>9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?<br/><br/>10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.<br/><br/>11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.<br/><br/>12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.<br/><br/>13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.<br/><br/>14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.<br/><br/>15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.<br/><br/>16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.<br/><br/>
