The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.<br/><br/>10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?<br/><br/>11 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.<br/><br/>12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.<br/><br/>13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.<br/><br/>
