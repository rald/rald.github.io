I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.<br/><br/>6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.<br/><br/>7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.<br/><br/>8 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?<br/><br/>9 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.<br/><br/>10 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.<br/><br/>11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.<br/><br/>12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.<br/><br/>13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.<br/><br/>14 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.<br/><br/>
