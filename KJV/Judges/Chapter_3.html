And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.<br/><br/>12 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.<br/><br/>13 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.<br/><br/>14 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.<br/><br/>15 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.<br/><br/>16 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.<br/><br/>17 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.<br/><br/>18 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.<br/><br/>19 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.<br/><br/>20 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.<br/><br/>21 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:<br/><br/>22 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.<br/><br/>23 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.<br/><br/>24 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.<br/><br/>25 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.<br/><br/>26 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.<br/><br/>27 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.<br/><br/>28 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.<br/><br/>29 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.<br/><br/>30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.<br/><br/>31 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.<br/><br/>
