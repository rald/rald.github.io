Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.<br/><br/>12 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.<br/><br/>13 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.<br/><br/>14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:<br/><br/>15 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.<br/><br/>16 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.<br/><br/>17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.<br/><br/>18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br/><br/>19 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.<br/><br/>20 Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.<br/><br/>21 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.<br/><br/>22 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. <br/><br/>
