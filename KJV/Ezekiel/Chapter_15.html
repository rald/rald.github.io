Is it meet for any work?<br/><br/>5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?<br/><br/>6 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<br/><br/>7 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.<br/><br/>8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.<br/><br/>
