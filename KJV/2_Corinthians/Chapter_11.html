God knoweth.<br/><br/>12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.<br/><br/>13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.<br/><br/>14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.<br/><br/>15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.<br/><br/>16 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.<br/><br/>17 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.<br/><br/>18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.<br/><br/>19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.<br/><br/>20 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.<br/><br/>21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.<br/><br/>22 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.<br/><br/>23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.<br/><br/>24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.<br/><br/>25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;<br/><br/>26 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;<br/><br/>27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.<br/><br/>28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.<br/><br/>29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?<br/><br/>30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.<br/><br/>31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.<br/><br/>32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:<br/><br/>33 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.<br/><br/>
