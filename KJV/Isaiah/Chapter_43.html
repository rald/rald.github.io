I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.<br/><br/>20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.<br/><br/>21 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.<br/><br/>22 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.<br/><br/>23 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.<br/><br/>24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.<br/><br/>25 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.<br/><br/>26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.<br/><br/>27 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.<br/><br/>28 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.<br/><br/>
