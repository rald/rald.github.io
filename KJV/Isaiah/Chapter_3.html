Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.<br/><br/>10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.<br/><br/>11 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.<br/><br/>12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.<br/><br/>13 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.<br/><br/>14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.<br/><br/>15 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.<br/><br/>16 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:<br/><br/>17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.<br/><br/>18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,<br/><br/>19 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,<br/><br/>20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,<br/><br/>21 The rings, and nose jewels,<br/><br/>22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,<br/><br/>23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.<br/><br/>24 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.<br/><br/>25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.<br/><br/>26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.<br/><br/>
