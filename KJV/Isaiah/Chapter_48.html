I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.<br/><br/>7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.<br/><br/>8 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.<br/><br/>9 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.<br/><br/>10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.<br/><br/>11 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.<br/><br/>12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.<br/><br/>13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.<br/><br/>14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.<br/><br/>15 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.<br/><br/>16 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.<br/><br/>17 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.<br/><br/>18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:<br/><br/>19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.<br/><br/>20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.<br/><br/>21 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.<br/><br/>22 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.<br/><br/>
