Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.<br/><br/>10 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.<br/><br/>11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.<br/><br/>12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,<br/><br/>13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?<br/><br/>14 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.<br/><br/>15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:<br/><br/>16 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:<br/><br/>17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.<br/><br/>18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.<br/><br/>19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.<br/><br/>20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.<br/><br/>21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.<br/><br/>22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.<br/><br/>23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!<br/><br/>24 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.<br/><br/>25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.<br/><br/>
