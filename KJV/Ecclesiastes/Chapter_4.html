This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.<br/><br/>5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.<br/><br/>6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.<br/><br/>7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.<br/><br/>8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.<br/><br/>9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.<br/><br/>10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.<br/><br/>11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?<br/><br/>12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.<br/><br/>13 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.<br/><br/>14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.<br/><br/>15 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.<br/><br/>16 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.<br/><br/>
