And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.<br/><br/>3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.<br/><br/>4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.<br/><br/>5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.<br/><br/>6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.<br/><br/>7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.<br/><br/>8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.<br/><br/>9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,<br/><br/>10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:<br/><br/>11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;<br/><br/>12 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.<br/><br/>13 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.<br/><br/>14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.<br/><br/>15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.<br/><br/>16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;<br/><br/>17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;<br/><br/>18 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.<br/><br/>
