and who is a rock, save our God?<br/><br/>33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.<br/><br/>34 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.<br/><br/>35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.<br/><br/>36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.<br/><br/>37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.<br/><br/>38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.<br/><br/>39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.<br/><br/>40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.<br/><br/>41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.<br/><br/>42 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.<br/><br/>43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.<br/><br/>44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.<br/><br/>45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.<br/><br/>46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.<br/><br/>47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.<br/><br/>48 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,<br/><br/>49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.<br/><br/>50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.<br/><br/>51 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.<br/><br/>
