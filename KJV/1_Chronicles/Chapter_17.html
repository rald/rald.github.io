Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.<br/><br/>11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.<br/><br/>12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.<br/><br/>13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:<br/><br/>14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.<br/><br/>15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.<br/><br/>16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?<br/><br/>17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.<br/><br/>18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.<br/><br/>19 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.<br/><br/>20 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br/><br/>21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?<br/><br/>22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.<br/><br/>23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.<br/><br/>24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.<br/><br/>25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.<br/><br/>26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:<br/><br/>27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.<br/><br/>
