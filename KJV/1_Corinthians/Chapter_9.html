Doth God take care for oxen?<br/><br/>10 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.<br/><br/>11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?<br/><br/>12 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.<br/><br/>13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?<br/><br/>14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.<br/><br/>15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.<br/><br/>16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!<br/><br/>17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.<br/><br/>18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.<br/><br/>19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.<br/><br/>20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;<br/><br/>21 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.<br/><br/>22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.<br/><br/>23 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.<br/><br/>24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.<br/><br/>25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.<br/><br/>26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:<br/><br/>27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.<br/><br/>
