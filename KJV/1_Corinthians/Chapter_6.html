Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?<br/><br/>6 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.<br/><br/>7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?<br/><br/>8 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.<br/><br/>9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,<br/><br/>10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.<br/><br/>11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.<br/><br/>12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.<br/><br/>13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.<br/><br/>14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.<br/><br/>15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.<br/><br/>16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.<br/><br/>17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.<br/><br/>18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.<br/><br/>19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br/><br/>20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<br/><br/>
