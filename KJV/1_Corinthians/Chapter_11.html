What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.<br/><br/>23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:<br/><br/>24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br/><br/>25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<br/><br/>26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br/><br/>27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<br/><br/>28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.<br/><br/>29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<br/><br/>30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.<br/><br/>31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.<br/><br/>32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.<br/><br/>33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.<br/><br/>34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.<br/><br/>
