For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<br/><br/>7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<br/><br/>8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.<br/><br/>9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:<br/><br/>10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.<br/><br/>11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.<br/><br/>12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.<br/><br/>13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:<br/><br/>14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.<br/><br/>15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.<br/><br/>16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.<br/><br/>17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.<br/><br/>18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br/><br/>19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:<br/><br/>20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.<br/><br/>21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.<br/><br/>22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.<br/><br/>23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:<br/><br/>24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.<br/><br/>25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<br/><br/>26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br/><br/>27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.<br/><br/>
