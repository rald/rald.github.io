If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.<br/><br/>3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.<br/><br/>4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.<br/><br/>5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!<br/><br/>6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.<br/><br/>7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:<br/><br/>8 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.<br/><br/>9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.<br/><br/>10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.<br/><br/>11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?<br/><br/>12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.<br/><br/>13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.<br/><br/>14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.<br/><br/>15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.<br/><br/>16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.<br/><br/>17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<br/><br/>18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.<br/><br/>
