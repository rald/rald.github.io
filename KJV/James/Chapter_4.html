Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.<br/><br/>7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br/><br/>8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.<br/><br/>9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.<br/><br/>10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.<br/><br/>11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.<br/><br/>12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?<br/><br/>13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:<br/><br/>14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.<br/><br/>15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.<br/><br/>16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.<br/><br/>17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.<br/><br/>
