Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?<br/><br/>7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?<br/><br/>8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:<br/><br/>9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.<br/><br/>10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.<br/><br/>11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.<br/><br/>12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.<br/><br/>13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.<br/><br/>14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?<br/><br/>15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br/><br/>16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<br/><br/>17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.<br/><br/>18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.<br/><br/>19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.<br/><br/>20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?<br/><br/>21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?<br/><br/>22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?<br/><br/>23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.<br/><br/>24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.<br/><br/>25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?<br/><br/>26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.<br/><br/>
