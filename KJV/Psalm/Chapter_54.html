Selah.<br/><br/>4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.<br/><br/>5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.<br/><br/>6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.<br/><br/>7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.<br/><br/>
