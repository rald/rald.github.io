Selah.<br/><br/>5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.<br/><br/>6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.<br/><br/>7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.<br/><br/>8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.<br/><br/>9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.<br/><br/>10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.<br/><br/>11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.<br/><br/>
