Selah.<br/><br/>3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.<br/><br/>4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.<br/><br/>5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.<br/><br/>6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.<br/><br/>7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.<br/><br/>8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.<br/><br/>
