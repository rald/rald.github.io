Higgaion. Selah.<br/><br/>17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.<br/><br/>18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.<br/><br/>19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.<br/><br/>20 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.<br/><br/>
