To day if ye will hear his voice,<br/><br/>8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:<br/><br/>9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.<br/><br/>10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:<br/><br/>11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.<br/><br/>
