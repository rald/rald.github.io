Selah.<br/><br/>9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.<br/><br/>10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.<br/><br/>11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.<br/><br/>12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.<br/><br/>13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.<br/><br/>14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.<br/><br/>
