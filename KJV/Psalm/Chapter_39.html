Selah.<br/><br/>6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.<br/><br/>7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.<br/><br/>8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.<br/><br/>9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.<br/><br/>10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.<br/><br/>11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.<br/><br/>12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.<br/><br/>13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.<br/><br/>
