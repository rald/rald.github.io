Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.<br/><br/>2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.<br/><br/>3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.<br/><br/>4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.<br/><br/>5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.<br/><br/>6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.<br/><br/>7 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:<br/><br/>8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:<br/><br/>9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:<br/><br/>10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:<br/><br/>11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:<br/><br/>12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:<br/><br/>13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.<br/><br/>14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.<br/><br/>
