Selah.<br/><br/>14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.<br/><br/>15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.<br/><br/>16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;<br/><br/>17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.<br/><br/>18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.<br/><br/>19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.<br/><br/>20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.<br/><br/>
