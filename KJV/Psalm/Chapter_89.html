Selah.<br/><br/>5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.<br/><br/>6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?<br/><br/>7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.<br/><br/>8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?<br/><br/>9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.<br/><br/>10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.<br/><br/>11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.<br/><br/>12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.<br/><br/>13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.<br/><br/>14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.<br/><br/>15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.<br/><br/>16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.<br/><br/>17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.<br/><br/>18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.<br/><br/>19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.<br/><br/>20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:<br/><br/>21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.<br/><br/>22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.<br/><br/>23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.<br/><br/>24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.<br/><br/>25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.<br/><br/>26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.<br/><br/>27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.<br/><br/>28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.<br/><br/>29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.<br/><br/>30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;<br/><br/>31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;<br/><br/>32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.<br/><br/>33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.<br/><br/>34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.<br/><br/>35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.<br/><br/>36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.<br/><br/>37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.<br/><br/>38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.<br/><br/>39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.<br/><br/>40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.<br/><br/>41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.<br/><br/>42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.<br/><br/>43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.<br/><br/>44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.<br/><br/>45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.<br/><br/>46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?<br/><br/>47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?<br/><br/>48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.<br/><br/>49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?<br/><br/>50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;<br/><br/>51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.<br/><br/>52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.<br/><br/>
