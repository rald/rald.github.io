Selah.<br/><br/>9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:<br/><br/>10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.<br/><br/>11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:<br/><br/>12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.<br/><br/>13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.<br/><br/>14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;<br/><br/>15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.<br/><br/>16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.<br/><br/>17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:<br/><br/>18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.<br/><br/>
