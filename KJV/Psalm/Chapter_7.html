Selah.<br/><br/>6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.<br/><br/>7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.<br/><br/>8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.<br/><br/>9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.<br/><br/>10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.<br/><br/>11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.<br/><br/>12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.<br/><br/>13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.<br/><br/>14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<br/><br/>15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.<br/><br/>16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.<br/><br/>17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.<br/><br/>
