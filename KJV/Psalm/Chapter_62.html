Selah.<br/><br/>5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.<br/><br/>6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.<br/><br/>7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.<br/><br/>8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.<br/><br/>9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.<br/><br/>10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.<br/><br/>11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.<br/><br/>12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.<br/><br/>
