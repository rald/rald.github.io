Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.<br/><br/>4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.<br/><br/>5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.<br/><br/>6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.<br/><br/>7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.<br/><br/>8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.<br/><br/>9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.<br/><br/>10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.<br/><br/>11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.<br/><br/>
