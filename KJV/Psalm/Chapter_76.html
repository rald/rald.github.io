Selah.<br/><br/>4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.<br/><br/>5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.<br/><br/>6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.<br/><br/>7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?<br/><br/>8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,<br/><br/>9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.<br/><br/>10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.<br/><br/>11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.<br/><br/>12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.<br/><br/>
