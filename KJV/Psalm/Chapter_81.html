Selah.<br/><br/>8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;<br/><br/>9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.<br/><br/>10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br/><br/>11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.<br/><br/>12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.<br/><br/>13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!<br/><br/>14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.<br/><br/>15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.<br/><br/>16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.<br/><br/>
