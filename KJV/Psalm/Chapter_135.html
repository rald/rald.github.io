Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.<br/><br/>2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,<br/><br/>3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.<br/><br/>4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.<br/><br/>5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.<br/><br/>6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.<br/><br/>7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.<br/><br/>8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.<br/><br/>9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.<br/><br/>10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;<br/><br/>11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:<br/><br/>12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.<br/><br/>13 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.<br/><br/>14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.<br/><br/>15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.<br/><br/>16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;<br/><br/>17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.<br/><br/>18 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.<br/><br/>19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:<br/><br/>20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.<br/><br/>21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.<br/><br/>
