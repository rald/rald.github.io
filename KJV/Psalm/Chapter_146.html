Praise the LORD, O my soul.<br/><br/>2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.<br/><br/>3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.<br/><br/>4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.<br/><br/>5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:<br/><br/>6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:<br/><br/>7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:<br/><br/>8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:<br/><br/>9 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.<br/><br/>10 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.<br/><br/>
