Selah.<br/><br/>20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.<br/><br/>21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.<br/><br/>22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:<br/><br/>23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.<br/><br/>24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.<br/><br/>25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.<br/><br/>26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.<br/><br/>27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.<br/><br/>28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.<br/><br/>29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.<br/><br/>30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.<br/><br/>31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.<br/><br/>32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:<br/><br/>33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.<br/><br/>34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.<br/><br/>35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.<br/><br/>
