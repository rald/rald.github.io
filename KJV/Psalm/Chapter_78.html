But while their meat was yet in their mouths,<br/><br/>31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.<br/><br/>32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.<br/><br/>33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.<br/><br/>34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.<br/><br/>35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.<br/><br/>36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.<br/><br/>37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.<br/><br/>38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.<br/><br/>39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<br/><br/>40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!<br/><br/>41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.<br/><br/>42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.<br/><br/>43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:<br/><br/>44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.<br/><br/>45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<br/><br/>46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.<br/><br/>47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.<br/><br/>48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br/><br/>49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.<br/><br/>50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<br/><br/>51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:<br/><br/>52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br/><br/>53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br/><br/>54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.<br/><br/>55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br/><br/>56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:<br/><br/>57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br/><br/>58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.<br/><br/>59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:<br/><br/>60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;<br/><br/>61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.<br/><br/>62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.<br/><br/>63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.<br/><br/>64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.<br/><br/>65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.<br/><br/>66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.<br/><br/>67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br/><br/>68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.<br/><br/>69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.<br/><br/>70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:<br/><br/>71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.<br/><br/>72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.<br/><br/>
