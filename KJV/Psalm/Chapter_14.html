They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.<br/><br/>2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.<br/><br/>3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br/><br/>4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.<br/><br/>5 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.<br/><br/>6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.<br/><br/>7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br/><br/>
