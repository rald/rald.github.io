Selah.<br/><br/>4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.<br/><br/>5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.<br/><br/>6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.<br/><br/>7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.<br/><br/>8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.<br/><br/>9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.<br/><br/>10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.<br/><br/>11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.<br/><br/>12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.<br/><br/>13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.<br/><br/>
