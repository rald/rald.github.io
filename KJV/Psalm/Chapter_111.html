I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.<br/><br/>2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.<br/><br/>3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.<br/><br/>4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.<br/><br/>5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.<br/><br/>6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.<br/><br/>7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.<br/><br/>8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.<br/><br/>9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.<br/><br/>10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.<br/><br/>
