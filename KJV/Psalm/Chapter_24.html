Selah.<br/><br/>7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.<br/><br/>8 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.<br/><br/>9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.<br/><br/>10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.<br/><br/>
