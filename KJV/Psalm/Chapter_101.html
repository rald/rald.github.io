O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.<br/><br/>3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.<br/><br/>4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.<br/><br/>5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.<br/><br/>6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.<br/><br/>7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.<br/><br/>8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.<br/><br/>
