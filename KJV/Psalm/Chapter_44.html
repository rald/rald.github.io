Selah.<br/><br/>9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.<br/><br/>10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.<br/><br/>11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.<br/><br/>12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.<br/><br/>13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.<br/><br/>14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.<br/><br/>15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,<br/><br/>16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.<br/><br/>17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.<br/><br/>18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;<br/><br/>19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.<br/><br/>20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;<br/><br/>21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.<br/><br/>22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.<br/><br/>23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.<br/><br/>24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?<br/><br/>25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.<br/><br/>26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.<br/><br/>
