Selah.<br/><br/>5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.<br/><br/>6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.<br/><br/>7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.<br/><br/>8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.<br/><br/>9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.<br/><br/>
