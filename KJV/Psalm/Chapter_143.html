Selah.<br/><br/>7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.<br/><br/>8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.<br/><br/>9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.<br/><br/>10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.<br/><br/>11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.<br/><br/>12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.<br/><br/>
