Selah.<br/><br/>8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.<br/><br/>9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.<br/><br/>10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.<br/><br/>11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?<br/><br/>12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?<br/><br/>13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.<br/><br/>14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?<br/><br/>15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.<br/><br/>16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.<br/><br/>17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.<br/><br/>18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.<br/><br/>
