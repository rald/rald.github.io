Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?<br/><br/>10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.<br/><br/>11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;<br/><br/>12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.<br/><br/>
