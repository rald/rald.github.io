Selah.<br/><br/>4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:<br/><br/>5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.<br/><br/>6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.<br/><br/>7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.<br/><br/>8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.<br/><br/>9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.<br/><br/>10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.<br/><br/>
