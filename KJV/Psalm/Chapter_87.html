Selah.<br/><br/>4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.<br/><br/>5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.<br/><br/>6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.<br/><br/>7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.<br/><br/>
