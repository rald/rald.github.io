Selah.<br/><br/>4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.<br/><br/>5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.<br/><br/>6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.<br/><br/>7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?<br/><br/>8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?<br/><br/>9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.<br/><br/>10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.<br/><br/>11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.<br/><br/>12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.<br/><br/>13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?<br/><br/>14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.<br/><br/>15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.<br/><br/>16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.<br/><br/>17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.<br/><br/>18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.<br/><br/>19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.<br/><br/>20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<br/><br/>
