Selah.<br/><br/>5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.<br/><br/>6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.<br/><br/>7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.<br/><br/>8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.<br/><br/>9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.<br/><br/>10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.<br/><br/>11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.<br/><br/>12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.<br/><br/>
