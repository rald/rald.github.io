Selah.<br/><br/>3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.<br/><br/>4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.<br/><br/>5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.<br/><br/>6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.<br/><br/>7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.<br/><br/>8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.<br/><br/>9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.<br/><br/>10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.<br/><br/>11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.<br/><br/>12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.<br/><br/>13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.<br/><br/>
