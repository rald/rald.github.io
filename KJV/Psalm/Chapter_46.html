Selah.<br/><br/>4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.<br/><br/>5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.<br/><br/>6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.<br/><br/>7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.<br/><br/>8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.<br/><br/>9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.<br/><br/>10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.<br/><br/>11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.<br/><br/>
