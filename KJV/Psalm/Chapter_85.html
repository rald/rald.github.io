Selah.<br/><br/>3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.<br/><br/>4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.<br/><br/>5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?<br/><br/>6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?<br/><br/>7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.<br/><br/>8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.<br/><br/>9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.<br/><br/>10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.<br/><br/>11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.<br/><br/>12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.<br/><br/>13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.<br/><br/>
