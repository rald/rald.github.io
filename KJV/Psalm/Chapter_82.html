Selah.<br/><br/>3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.<br/><br/>4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.<br/><br/>5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.<br/><br/>6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.<br/><br/>7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.<br/><br/>8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.<br/><br/>
