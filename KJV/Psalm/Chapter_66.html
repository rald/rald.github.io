Selah.<br/><br/>5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.<br/><br/>6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.<br/><br/>7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.<br/><br/>8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:<br/><br/>9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.<br/><br/>10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.<br/><br/>11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.<br/><br/>12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.<br/><br/>13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,<br/><br/>14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.<br/><br/>15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.<br/><br/>16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.<br/><br/>17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.<br/><br/>18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:<br/><br/>19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.<br/><br/>20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.<br/><br/>
