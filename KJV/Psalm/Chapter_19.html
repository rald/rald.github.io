In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,<br/><br/>5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.<br/><br/>6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.<br/><br/>7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.<br/><br/>8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br/><br/>9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.<br/><br/>10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.<br/><br/>11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.<br/><br/>12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.<br/><br/>13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.<br/><br/>14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.<br/><br/>
