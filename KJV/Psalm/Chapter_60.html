Selah.<br/><br/>5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.<br/><br/>6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.<br/><br/>7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;<br/><br/>8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.<br/><br/>9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?<br/><br/>10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?<br/><br/>11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.<br/><br/>12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.<br/><br/>
