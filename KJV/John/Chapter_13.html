Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.<br/><br/>9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.<br/><br/>10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.<br/><br/>11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.<br/><br/>12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?<br/><br/>13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.<br/><br/>14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.<br/><br/>15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.<br/><br/>16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.<br/><br/>17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.<br/><br/>18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.<br/><br/>19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.<br/><br/>20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.<br/><br/>21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.<br/><br/>22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.<br/><br/>23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.<br/><br/>24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.<br/><br/>25 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?<br/><br/>26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.<br/><br/>27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.<br/><br/>28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.<br/><br/>29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.<br/><br/>30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.<br/><br/>31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<br/><br/>32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.<br/><br/>33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.<br/><br/>34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<br/><br/>35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.<br/><br/>36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.<br/><br/>37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.<br/><br/>38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.<br/><br/>
