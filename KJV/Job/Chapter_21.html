God distributeth sorrows in his anger.<br/><br/>18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.<br/><br/>19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.<br/><br/>20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.<br/><br/>21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?<br/><br/>22 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.<br/><br/>23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.<br/><br/>24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.<br/><br/>25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.<br/><br/>26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.<br/><br/>27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.<br/><br/>28 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?<br/><br/>29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,<br/><br/>30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.<br/><br/>31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?<br/><br/>32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.<br/><br/>33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.<br/><br/>34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?<br/><br/>
