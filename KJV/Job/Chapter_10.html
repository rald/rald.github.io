I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;<br/><br/>16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.<br/><br/>17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.<br/><br/>18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!<br/><br/>19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.<br/><br/>20 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,<br/><br/>21 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;<br/><br/>22 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.<br/><br/>
