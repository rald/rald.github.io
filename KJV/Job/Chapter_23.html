No; but he would put strength in me.<br/><br/>7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.<br/><br/>8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:<br/><br/>9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:<br/><br/>10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.<br/><br/>11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.<br/><br/>12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.<br/><br/>13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.<br/><br/>14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.<br/><br/>15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.<br/><br/>16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:<br/><br/>17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.<br/><br/>
