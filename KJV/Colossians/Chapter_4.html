They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.<br/><br/>10 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)<br/><br/>11 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.<br/><br/>12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.<br/><br/>13 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.<br/><br/>14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.<br/><br/>15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.<br/><br/>16 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.<br/><br/>17 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.<br/><br/>18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen. <br/><br/>
