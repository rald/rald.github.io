It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.<br/><br/>24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:<br/><br/>25 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.<br/><br/>26 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.<br/><br/>27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.<br/><br/>28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.<br/><br/>29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.<br/><br/>30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;<br/><br/>31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.<br/><br/>32 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.<br/><br/>33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:<br/><br/>34 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.<br/><br/>
