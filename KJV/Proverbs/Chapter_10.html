A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.<br/><br/>2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.<br/><br/>3 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.<br/><br/>4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.<br/><br/>5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.<br/><br/>6 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.<br/><br/>7 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.<br/><br/>8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.<br/><br/>9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.<br/><br/>10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.<br/><br/>11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.<br/><br/>12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.<br/><br/>13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.<br/><br/>14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.<br/><br/>15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.<br/><br/>16 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.<br/><br/>17 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.<br/><br/>18 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.<br/><br/>19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.<br/><br/>20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.<br/><br/>21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.<br/><br/>22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.<br/><br/>23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.<br/><br/>24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.<br/><br/>25 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.<br/><br/>26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.<br/><br/>27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.<br/><br/>28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.<br/><br/>29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.<br/><br/>30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.<br/><br/>31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.<br/><br/>32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.<br/><br/>
