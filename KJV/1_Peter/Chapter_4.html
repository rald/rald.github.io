Amen.<br/><br/>12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:<br/><br/>13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.<br/><br/>14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.<br/><br/>15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.<br/><br/>16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.<br/><br/>17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?<br/><br/>18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?<br/><br/>19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.<br/><br/>
