Amen.<br/><br/>26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<br/><br/>27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<br/><br/>28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<br/><br/>29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<br/><br/>30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<br/><br/>31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:<br/><br/>32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<br/><br/>
