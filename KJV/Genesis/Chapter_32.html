For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.<br/><br/>21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.<br/><br/>22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.<br/><br/>23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.<br/><br/>24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.<br/><br/>25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.<br/><br/>26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.<br/><br/>27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.<br/><br/>28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.<br/><br/>29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.<br/><br/>30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.<br/><br/>31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.<br/><br/>32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.<br/><br/>
