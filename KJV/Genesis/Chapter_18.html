And they said, So do, as thou hast said.<br/><br/>6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.<br/><br/>7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.<br/><br/>8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.<br/><br/>9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.<br/><br/>10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.<br/><br/>11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.<br/><br/>12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?<br/><br/>13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?<br/><br/>14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.<br/><br/>15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.<br/><br/>16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.<br/><br/>17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;<br/><br/>18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?<br/><br/>19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.<br/><br/>20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;<br/><br/>21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.<br/><br/>22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.<br/><br/>23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?<br/><br/>24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?<br/><br/>25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?<br/><br/>26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.<br/><br/>27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:<br/><br/>28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.<br/><br/>29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.<br/><br/>30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.<br/><br/>31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.<br/><br/>32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.<br/><br/>33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.<br/><br/>
