And he gave him tithes of all.<br/><br/>21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.<br/><br/>22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,<br/><br/>23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:<br/><br/>24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.<br/><br/>
