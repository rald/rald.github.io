Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:<br/><br/>23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:<br/><br/>24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:<br/><br/>25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:<br/><br/>26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.<br/><br/>27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.<br/><br/>28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.<br/><br/>29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.<br/><br/>
