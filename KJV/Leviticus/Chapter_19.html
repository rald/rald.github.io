Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.<br/><br/>20 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.<br/><br/>21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.<br/><br/>22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.<br/><br/>23 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.<br/><br/>24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.<br/><br/>25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.<br/><br/>26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.<br/><br/>27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.<br/><br/>28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.<br/><br/>29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.<br/><br/>30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.<br/><br/>31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.<br/><br/>32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.<br/><br/>33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.<br/><br/>34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.<br/><br/>35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.<br/><br/>36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.<br/><br/>
