The Lord is at hand.<br/><br/>6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<br/><br/>7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<br/><br/>8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.<br/><br/>9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.<br/><br/>10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.<br/><br/>11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.<br/><br/>12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.<br/><br/>13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br/><br/>14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.<br/><br/>15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.<br/><br/>16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.<br/><br/>17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.<br/><br/>18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.<br/><br/>19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.<br/><br/>20 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br/><br/>21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.<br/><br/>22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.<br/><br/>23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. <br/><br/>
