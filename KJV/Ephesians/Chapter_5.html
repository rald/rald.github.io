He that loveth his wife loveth himself.<br/><br/>29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:<br/><br/>30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<br/><br/>31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.<br/><br/>32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.<br/><br/>33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.<br/><br/>
