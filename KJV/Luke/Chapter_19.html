Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:<br/><br/>23 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?<br/><br/>24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.<br/><br/>25 And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)<br/><br/>26 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.<br/><br/>27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.<br/><br/>28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.<br/><br/>29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,<br/><br/>30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.<br/><br/>31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.<br/><br/>32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.<br/><br/>33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?<br/><br/>34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.<br/><br/>35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.<br/><br/>36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.<br/><br/>37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;<br/><br/>38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.<br/><br/>39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.<br/><br/>40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.<br/><br/>41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,<br/><br/>42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.<br/><br/>43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,<br/><br/>44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.<br/><br/>45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;<br/><br/>46 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.<br/><br/>47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,<br/><br/>48 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.<br/><br/>
