And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?<br/><br/>6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.<br/><br/>7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.<br/><br/>8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<br/><br/>9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br/><br/>10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:<br/><br/>11 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;<br/><br/>12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.<br/><br/>13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?<br/><br/>14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?<br/><br/>
