These things are good and profitable unto men.<br/><br/>9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.<br/><br/>10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;<br/><br/>11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.<br/><br/>12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.<br/><br/>13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.<br/><br/>14 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.<br/><br/>15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. <br/><br/>
