Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;<br/><br/>14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.<br/><br/>15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.<br/><br/>16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.<br/><br/>
